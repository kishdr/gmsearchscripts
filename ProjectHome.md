_A Greasemonkey script to replace the logo on the Google homepage and search results page with your personal favorite Google Doodle._ Don't worry, you'll still see new logos on holidays!

## To install ##
First make sure you are using <a href='http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/'>Firefox</a> and have <a href='https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/748'>Greasemonkey</a> installed. Then go to the script source and you will be prompted to install it. The great thing about Greasemonkey is you don't even need to restart Firefox! To verify that the script is working go to <a href='http://google.com'><a href='http://google.com'>http://google.com</a></a> and you should see an awesome Lego doodle in place of the regular Google logo.

## To choose your favorite doodle ##
Find your way to the official <a href='http://www.google.com/logos'>Google Doodle Gallery</a> - you can get there by clicking on the newly displayed Lego doodle or by selecting "Favorite Doodle -> Choose favorite doodle" from the Greasemonkey menu (to get there you can right click on the cute monkey face at the bottom right of your firefox window and go to "User Script Commands"). Note that the menu options for this script are only displayed when you are on the Google homepage or search results page.

After you have navigated to the gallery you can browse through the collection of past doodles - the hardest part is picking a favorite! Below each image is a button that says "Make This My Favorite Doodle", simply click the button under your favorite doodle and you will be redirected back to the Google homepage (now showing your favorite doodle!). You can change your favorite as many times as you want.

## What happens on holidays? ##
By default the script will override your favorite doodle on holidays or any days with a special doodle (personally, I never want to miss a new doodle on the Google homepage). After the holiday is over your favorite doodle will be back. However, you can change this preference so that your favorite is always shown. To do this go to the Greasemonkey "User Script Commands" menu and select "Favorite Doodle -> Always show my favorite doodle, even on holidays". If you decide you want to change the preference back again simply select "Favorite Doodle -> Override my favorite doodle on holidays".

## Update notification ##
The script will check for updates once a day. If an updated version is available it will prompt you by displaying a note in a red box at the bottom of the page. If you choose to download the new version just click the link. If you don't want to be notified of any updates you can turn this feature off by selecting "Favorite Doodle -> Never check for updates" from the Greasemonkey "User Script Commands" menu. To turn the notification back on select "Favorite Doodle -> Check for updates daily".

## Will this work in Chrome? ##
Update: A <a href='https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/nedjejdfkkjgebciefdfofjhmeogiaga'>Chrome version of Favorite Doodle</a> is now available!
